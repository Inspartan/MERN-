This is a basic MERN stack application built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 
It demonstrates core CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) without authentication. 
The project is ideal for learning, small-scale apps, or as a foundation for more advanced projects 
with API integration and soon an authentication.
